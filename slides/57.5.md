##  Q2-3. What is the output of the following code?

    public class Foo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        long b = 20;
        short c = 30;
        System.out.println(++a + b++ * c);
        }
    }

<p class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="2">a 611</p>
<p>b 641</p>
<p>c 930</p>
<p>d 960</p>

<p class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1">Answer?</p>


note:
    Explanation: The prefix increment operator (++) used with the variable a will increment
    its value before it is used in the expression ++a + b++ * c. The postfix increment
    operator (++) used with the variable b will increment its value after its initial value is
    used in the expression ++a + b++ * c.<br/>
    Therefore, the expression ++a + b++ * c, evaluates with the following values:
    11 + 20 * 30<br/>
    Because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator,
    the values 20 and 30 are multiplied before the result is added to the value 11.
    The example expression evaluates as follows:<br/>
    (++a + b++ * c)
    = 11 + 20 * 30
    = 11 + 600
    = 611
