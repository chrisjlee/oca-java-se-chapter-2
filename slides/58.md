### Q2-4. Select the option(s) that is/are the best choice for the following:
<p>[BLANK]  should be used to store a count of cars manufactured by a car manufacturing company.</p>
<p>[BLANK]  should be used to store whether this car manufacturing company modifies the interiors on the customer’s request.</p>
<p>[BLANK]  should be used to store the maximum speed of a car.</p>

<p class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">a. long, boolean, double</p>
<p>b. long, int, float</p>
<p>c. char, int, double</p>
<p class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">d. long, boolean, float</p>


<p class="fragment roll-in">Answer: a, d</p>

note:

    Options (a) and (d) are correct. Use a long data type to store big number values, a
    boolean data type to store yes/no values as true/false, and a double or float to
    store decimal numbers.
    Option (b) is incorrect. You can’t use an int to store yes/no or true/false values.
    Option (c) is incorrect. You can’t use a char data type to store very long values (such
    as the count of cars manufactured by the car manufacturer until a certain date). Also,
    it’s conceptually incorrect to track counts using the char data type.
