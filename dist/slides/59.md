###  Q2-5. Which of the following options contain correct code to declare and initialize variables to store whole numbers?


<p>a.   bit a = 0;</p>
<p>b.   integer a2 = 7;</p>
<p  class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">c.   long a3 = 0x10C;</p>
<p  class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">d.   short a4 = 0512;</p>
<p>e.   double a5 = 10;</p>
<p  class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">f.   byte a7 = -0;</p>
<p  class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">g.   long a8 = 123456789;</p>


<p class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="2">Answer: c, d, f, g</p>

note:
    Explanation:
    Options (a) and (b) are incorrect. There are no primitive data types in Java with
    the names bit and integer. The correct names are byte and int.
    Option (c) is correct. It assigns a hexadecimal literal value to the variable a3.
    Option (d) is correct. It assigns an octal literal value to the variable a4.
    Option (e) is incorrect. It defines a variable of type double, which is used to store
    decimal numbers, not integers.
    Option (f) is correct. -0 is a valid literal value.
    Option (g) is correct. 123456789 is a valid integer literal value that can be assigned
    to a variable of type long.
